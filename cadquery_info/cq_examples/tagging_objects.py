"""
Tagging objects
=================
The Workplane.tag() method can be used to tag a particular object in the chain with a string, so that it can be
referred to later in the chain.

The Workplane.workplaneFromTagged() method applies Workplane.copyWorkplane() to a tagged object. For example,
when extruding two different solids from a surface, after the first solid is extruded it can become difficult to
reselect the original surface with CadQuery’s other selectors.
"""

import cadquery as cq

result = (
    cq.Workplane("XY")
    # create and tag the base workplane
    .box(10, 10, 10)
    .faces(">Z")
    .workplane()
    .tag("baseplane")
    # extrude a cylinder
    .center(-3, 0)
    .circle(1)
    .extrude(3)
    # to reselect the base workplane, simply
    .workplaneFromTagged("baseplane")
    # extrude a second cylinder
    .center(3, 0)
    .circle(1)
    .extrude(2)
)

"""
Tags can also be used with most selectors, including Workplane.vertices(), Workplane.faces(), Workplane.edges(), 
Workplane.wires(), Workplane.shells(), Workplane.solids() and Workplane.compounds().

    # create a sphere that obscures the prism
    .sphere(10)
