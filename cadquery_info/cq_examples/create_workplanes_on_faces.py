"""
Creating Workplanes on Faces
==============================
This example shows how to locate a new workplane on the face of a previously created feature.

Note:
Using workplanes in this way are a key feature of CadQuery. Unlike a typical 3d scripting language, using work planes
frees you from tracking the position of various features in variables, and allows the model to adjust itself with
removing redundant dimensions

The Workplane.faces() method allows you to select the faces of a resulting solid. It accepts a selector string or
object, that allows you to target a single face, and make a workplane oriented on that face.

Keep in mind that by default the origin of a new workplane is calculated by forming a plane from the selected face
and projecting the previous origin onto that plane. This behaviour can be changed through the centerOption argument
of Workplane.workplane().

import cadquery as cq

result = cq.Workplane("front").box(2, 3, 0.5)  # make a basic prism
result = (
    result.faces(">Z").workplane().hole(0.5)
)  # find the top-most face and make a hole
