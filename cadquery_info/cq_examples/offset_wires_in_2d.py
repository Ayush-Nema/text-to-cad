Offsetting wires in 2D
========================
Two dimensional wires can be transformed with Workplane.offset2D(). They can be offset inwards or outwards,
and with different techniques for extending the corners.

Using the forConstruction argument you can do the common task of offsetting a series of bolt holes from the outline 
of an object. Here is the counterbore example from above but with the bolt holes offset from the edges.

"""
Note that Workplane.edges() is for selecting objects. It does not add the selected edges to pending edges in the 
modelling context, because this would result in your next extrusion including everything you had only selected in 
addition to the lines you had drawn. To specify you want these edges to be used in Workplane.offset2D(), 
you call Workplane.toPending() to explicitly put them in the list of pending edges.
