"""
Using Point Lists
====================
Sometimes you need to create a number of features at various locations, and using Workplane.center() is too cumbersome.

You can use a list of points to construct multiple objects at once. Most construction methods, like Workplane.circle(
) and Workplane.rect(), will operate on multiple points if they are on the stack
"""

import cadquery as cq

r = cq.Workplane("front").circle(2.0)  # make base
r = r.pushPoints(
    [(1.5, 0), (0, 1.5), (-1.5, 0), (0, -1.5)]
)  # now four points are on the stack
r = r.circle(0.25)  # circle will operate on all four points
result = r.extrude(0.125)  # make prism
