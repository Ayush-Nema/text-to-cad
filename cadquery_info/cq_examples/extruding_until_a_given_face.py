Extruding until a given face
================================
Sometimes you will want to extrude a wire until a given face that can be not planar or where you might not know
easily the distance you have to extrude to. In such cases you can use next, last or even give a Face object for the
until argument of extrude().

Warning

If the wire you want to extrude cannot be fully projected on the target surface, the result will be unpredictable. 
Furthermore, the algorithm in charge of finding the candidate faces does its search by counting all the faces 
intersected by a line created from your wire center along your extrusion direction. So make sure your wire can be 
projected on your target face to avoid unexpected behaviour.
